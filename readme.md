## What is Automation?
Automation involves using software tools and scripts to perform repetitive tasks automatically. It saves time, reduces human error, and allows you to focus on more important aspects of your work.

## Using Selenium and Beautiful Soup
- **Selenium**: A powerful library for automating web browsers. It allows you to interact with web pages, fill forms, click buttons, and more.
- **Beautiful Soup (BS4)**: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It simplifies extracting data from web pages.

## About This Repository
- **Beginner-Friendly**: The code examples are designed for beginners, with clear explanations and step-by-step instructions.
- **Modifiable Python Code**: Feel free to modify and adapt the code snippets to your specific use cases.
- **Fork and Develop**: Fork this repository and create your own automation projects based on the provided examples.
